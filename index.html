        <p>Learning to code is intimidating, so set yourself up for success with a tool built for you. Visual Studio Code is a free coding editor that helps you start coding quickly. Use it to code in any programming language, without switching editors. Visual Studio Code has support for many languages, including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more.</p>
        <h5>-> Download and install VS Code.
           -> Create a new file.
           -> See an overview of the user interface.
           -> Install support for your favorite programming language.
           -> Change your keyboard shortcuts and easily migrate from other editors using keymap extensions.
           -> Customize your editor with themes.

        <p>To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows).
            As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window.
            You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>

            console.log("My First Console Project");
            var first_name="Samagna ";
            var last_name="ASV";
            console.log(first_name.concat(last_name));
            var a = 10;
            var b = 5;

            var add = a + b;
            console.log(add);
            var subtract= a - b;
            console.log(subtract);
            var multiply= a * b;
            console.log(multiply);
            var divide= a / b;
            console.log(divide);
